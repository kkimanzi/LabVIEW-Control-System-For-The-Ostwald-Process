Hello

-> Open the project file in its source directory

-> program.vi is the main VI -> you can open it

-> Set the path to the excel file to be used for logging. A new file (path to a non-existent file) on the source directory is best to avoid formating issues that may result from opening a file previously editted (thus format changed) by excel program

 a .xls file is best (.xlsx has more formatting requirements)

-> Run the python script for creating the HTML file with dynamic prices

-> Set the program parameters to normal values before simulation

-> You can then start the simulation

-> Toggle on the Run Plant switch

-> All utilities go online.

-> You can turn on a valve

-> To simulate faulty conditions, vary the horizontal slide scales to extreme levels

-> Affected utilies turn red

-> If the simulation crashes, kill the process via ctrl+alt+del and repeat.

-> Lets preview the log file though

-> Open excel and navigate to the saved file location

-> The triggered faults have been recorded
